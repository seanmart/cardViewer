          "My proudest moment at CompanyA was getting the phone call from a nurse at a CMHC who shared their first success story with the first patient they started on BrandC Maintena after working with them for about 6 months! Her story included improvements in her patients overall involvement in his church, community and family! He even had started picking up his kids at school again. As the nurse put it, I helped them help a family get their Dad back by teaching them about BrandC Maintena so they knew to offer it to this patient. I was extremely proud of my drug and the fact I got to play a small part in helping a patient get back to being an active part of his family! It doesnt get much better than that! This is core of our mission!"

One was when Pete Earley spoke at a Town Hall and his heartfelt words of thanks for medications like the ones CompanyA has developed and for seeing his son, who suffers from mental illness, as a \"person of worth,\" has stuck with me immensely. Also, after BrandA was approved, the outpouring of positive comments and statements of hope on the PKD Foundation's Facebook page was extremely moving and made me realize the impact we are having on people's lives. These moments made me feel proud and showcased that the work we do at CompanyA can be literally life changing, and sometimes lifesaving. It reaffirmed the importance of the work CompanyA does."

When tolvaptan got approved for ADPKD, several patients that we spoke to were so thankful to have some kind of therapy for their disease. I am proud to be part of a tenacious organization that put in 14 years of research to help these patients. Being a PKD researcher, I always wondered about treatment and living with ADPKD. Knowing that most of these patients end up in dialysis or transplant made me very motivated to help them in some way. It is exciting to be part of the team that provided some hope to patients with ADPKD."

I went to a clinic for the first time and when I met the psychiatrist we both realized we had interacted professionally over a decade ago. She opened up to me about her work with a PACT and shared a detailed journey of a patient she treated with our product. The patient had gone from a low point of homelessness and sleeping in a train station with her teenage daughter to working two jobs and sharing housing. It wasnt an everyday story of how it goes. I could hear the emotion in her voice as this doctor told me this story and it literally gave me the chills. She called in her case worker to meet me and we continued. Just a few weeks in and already getting hugs? What?  I had the feeling this is why Im here. It seriously felt like a supernatural message to let me know its right and being here matters."

I am especially proud when a customer treats me like an extension of their treatment team. My most recent accomplishment, as a trusted consultant for a long-acting injectable hospital system protocol, has the potential to impact hundreds of patients and their families. Realizing the profound impact BrandC Maintena has had for patients and their families reinforces my sense of urgency to consult with healthcare professionals. Our work isnt done until every appropriate patient has been offered a long acting treatment option. Its exciting to think about how Ive helped customers shift their mindset to offer BrandC Maintena earlier in a patients illness regardless of compliance. Shifting long acting injectable protocols from punitive to indication all-inclusive has the potential to keep more patients well. Wellness and symptom stability might keep patient relationships intact and help them pursue their life goals."

Many patients are stable  they are working as well as possible in the community. This has completely changed his perspective on this treatment option. It has now become his first line use! He was open to re-evaluation and treating more patients with better outcomes. Its a great feeling to see more patients having better outcomes and symptom control.

The doctor and treatment team were so grateful because this patient had tried and refused so many medications but liked BrandC.I felt like I was doing the job I was meant for! The research, my knowledge of the medication and the system of care all came together to help someone get off the streets! In this patients case, possibly life or death!

The initial ADPKD clinical program was quite lengthy with the single, global pivotal study taking over 5 years to complete (first patient in through database lock). Study outcomes and the risk/benefit were then taken to an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2013. While the initial application was not approved, a pathway for further development in the US was agreed upon with the Agency and resulted in an NDA approval in April 2018. In that 5-year period, we also obtained approvals in Japan ('14), Europe ('15) and Canada ('15). The experience was a testament to the global team's perseverance. The time and dedication evolved into an intrinsic drive within the team. A phrase commonly heard was \"I just want to see this through\". We had a common goal and would not relent until we succeeded. We were committed to help a niche patient population with an unmet medical need. It was another example of creating new products for better health worldwide."

I got to meet and work with 2 physician key opinion leaders in my territory that later became speakers for CompanyA. These two HCPs taught me everything I know about hyponatremia, nephrology and tolvaptan. Working with these two physicians showed me how to teach other HCPs about the hyponatremia disease state and demonstrate the value of tolvaptan, the first vasopressin V2 antagonist, that helped patients with hyponatremia like no other medication. This was patient healthcare done the CompanyA way. There was adversity that went along with promoting tolvaptan. Tolvaptan was a first in class medication that forever changed the paradigm of treating hyponatremia. The CompanyA way was about being on the cutting edge of societal medicine and challenging conventional wisdom and succeeding."

This milestone for our program made me feel very proud of the team and grateful to work at an organization that is truly patient-centric. I am fortunate to have been with the program since the pilot of LCCs in only 4 states through the expansion to all 50 states. The patient, caregiver, and HCP stories about how this network has helped their patients has been incredible. I truly feel like CompanyA Patient Support and our matrix colleagues in Government Affairs have been a voice for a seemingly \"voiceless\" population of people with serious mental illness to help build the network, help drive policy changes for pharmacist-administration of LAIs, and find solutions for patients. Providing an alternate injection location for patients to receive their prescribed medication has changed the way LAIs are delivered across the US. For many patients, they would have no way to receive an injection if it weren't for our network of LCCs. This has enabled HCPs a method to get patients BrandC Maintena where they may not have been able to previously. We've learned a lot and partnered with key stakeholders through the LCC build and implementation, and we will be leveraging these insights into new Patient Support offerings in 2019 and beyond. CompanyA Patient Support is improving health for patients through easier access and consistent support throughout their treatment experience."

He finally did a while later, and within a month of diagnosis, he was also diagnosed with stomach cancer. He actually died within a month of diagnosis. While I was motivated to promote h. pylori awareness and testing prior to this happening, this event created a fire within myself to really challenge HCPs that it might not be indigestion when patients list H2 blockers, omeprazole or other OTC options in their medication history, and they should further explore what CAUSES these symptoms. If only a doctor had recognized that long-term self-medication with OTC medications to treat stomach symptoms could possibly be as simple as treating a bacterial infection and prevent the pain and suffering of stomach cancer. Also, I wonder if my Dad could have had a bit more time with his grandchildren, friends and family? I hope my challenging HCPs to find the cause of stomach symptoms prevents this from occurring to other families. When HCPs tell me they dont see h. Pylori in their patients, I simply ask if any of their patients take omeprazole or other OTC meds. The answer is yes, and we are able to have a meaningful conversation. HCPs who said they didn't test, now say they do! Everyone should know that BrandE, a simple breath test, can increase the probability that a patient gets diagnosed and treated. This could mean an outcome that leads to a life that isnt cut short simply because a patient thought its just a little indigestion."

When we were talking at this dinner I said she seemed a lot better and she responded by saying that she had started taking BrandC and that it had made all the difference. She felt much better. When I told her that I worked for the company that had developed aripiprazole she said, thank you - seriously, thank you. I told her that I was definitely not the right person to thank but she was adamant - it was that important to express gratitude for the difference made. This kind of moment certainly makes me proud to work at CompanyA. But, it also made me think about all of the ways in which treatments can impact individuals beyond just their doctors office and their experience as a patient. Its about their experience of life. Health is probably the most fundamental aspect of any persons subjective experience of life and what it means, and to have a body and live in the world. Having this happen to a close friend brought the experience home in a way that even the experience of other patients cannot. The people CompanyA serves should be front and foremost in every thought and every action we take as a company. It is so easy to lose sight of this impact and the more opportunities we have to connect to our purpose, the better we can serve in a way that is productive, sustainable, and even joyful.

He says it's because of CompanyA that he has the opportunity to feel this joy. I felt joy for this unknown person instantly and for me it is this type of positive patient experience that makes me most proud to be an CompanyA-person.

I never saw her not happy and I'll never know if there was more that I could have done for her. I do know that I wouldn't wish the hurt she obviously experienced within or that I experienced with her loss on anyone. So, every day that I come to work at CompanyA, I come in with hope and with the intention to do my job well to help the business make good decisions on how to help patients get the same joy in life as the speaker at the POA. It is possible and we can help. Sometimes we take the simple things for granted and we dismiss how simple they are to many of us, but it's those same simple things that these patients are unable to experience due to their illness.

It made me feel proud to help that individual, but I also felt happiness for that patient and his family and the difference we made in their lives. It makes a huge difference  it shows that all we do makes a huge difference in patients lives as well as the lives of their families."

We met several times and we discussed the fact that there was no PKD clinic or central place within a 50-mile radius that provides a PKD focused place for patients to go. I provided him with education and connected him with other KOLs that have done similar clinics around the country. With this knowledge, he opened his PKD clinic and now sees severe PKD patients throughout the region, providing them with comprehensive care. One of the key drivers for me in my career is making sure that I am doing something that matters, not just checking boxes. Providing the education to this KOL and helping to make connections in order to get the first PKD clinic in the region off the ground was very impactful for me. I was inspired by even just one patient receiving treatment. Fortunately, many more than one have been treated! This makes me feel proud that I can have a small part in changing these patients lives. This helps the patients CompanyA serves by providing them with comprehensive care through the PKD clinic.

Then her mother told her side of the story around the struggles and anxiety she experienced during the various psychotic episodes her daughter went through. It hit home with me and those in the audience, that what we do every day really matters. When you hear the difficulties, by the patient and caregiver, you know you are making a difference out there. I then observed Account Managers share the video of this same patient with their HCPs and how well it connected. The video with a real - life patient, helped bring authenticity to our product message. Having a family member who suffered with schizophrenia, who had a job, was married, had family who cared  then they just gave up, reminded me how volatile these patients are. Hearing what these patients with mental illness go through and how much help they need, brings extra passion and commitment from our sales teams  to want to help their HCP help their patients.

We had little ability to commercialize our medicines in the United States without leaning on a Big Pharma Partner. Since that time, I have watched this organization grow from those small US roots to a major player in Neuroscience and Nephrology. It has been an honor to have been part of that growth over the last 17 years. We brought BrandC Tablets from a small beginning as the 5th Atypical launched to ending its run as the #1 drug in the United States in terms of dollar sales. In that time, we helped millions of people! I have heard countless stories over the years from Health Care Practitioners on the positive impact our medicines have had on the lives of patients and their families. Mental Illness does not just affect those afflicted but also their families and all who love them. Schizophrenia can take a healthy 21-year-old in college with everything in the world going for them to someone cut off from society and estranged from their family in a few short years. People with Major Depressive Disorder have dramatically higher rates of Divorce, Unemployment and Suicide. I am inspired by the stories I hear about the people our medicines have helped. Each member of my Mid Atlantic sales team wears the Green Ribbon through the course of their day in sales calls. Wearing the GREEN each day is meant to remind us we need to remove the stigma of Mental Illness and help those who suffer be the best that they can be. Our CompanyA people who research and develop, commercialize and promote medicine can positively change the lives of so many folks they will never know. One day I will retire from pharma to pursue the next challenge of my life. Now, until my last day I will always know I spent my life working to help so many who needed it most.

It is rather a teaspoonful contribution in an ocean of innovative MyCite product. However, what differentiated the experience was that the leadership provided a platform to listen to an unconventional idea without being bound by functional area and reporting lines i.e. really focused on business outcomes. Once vetted, leadership provided support and freedom to execute towards an end goal. The Digital Medicines team collaboration and perseverance to address different obstacles through that 6-8 month journey was by far the most memorable. It made me believe that anyone with a good idea and ability to persevere can make a difference at CompanyA. You will be heard eventually even if the platform does not exist in other places.

          "A memorable moment for me in CompanyA history is when the results from the second pivotal trial for tolvaptan in ADPKD came in as positive, and the resubmission to the FDA was approved. Some companies would have abandoned this effort after the first pivotal trial. These events made me proud to work for a company that is bigger than the profits it makes. These moments can affect patients with ADPKD, by offering a therapy that directly targets their disease and not just management of their symptoms. These moments have provided hope to a patient population that can sometimes feel abandoned, and hope is often an important part of therapy that gets overlooked."

I have had the privilege of working for many years with the pioneers of PKD research in trying to understand the pathophysiology of the disease. To now be part of changing the treatment paradigm for ADPKD in this country and the world over, is an indescribable feeling. The thing that moved me the most was the weight of countless patients who for decades were waiting for a treatment for ADPKD. The story of tolvaptan as a treatment for ADPKD has been long and arduous. Many of the best and brightest scientists and clinicians have been and still are working to eliminate the suffering caused by this debilitating genetic disease. CompanyA cared enough to join the fight, to commit to the cause, and to persevere in the face of multiple obstacles to get this medication approved for patients all over the world. On behalf of my friends that have PKD, I am so thrilled to work for CompanyA. CompanyA is helping to create a better world for thousands of ADPKD patients by giving them hope for a better future not only for themselves, but for their children and grandchildren. We are a part of changing the future of ADPKD treatment by being the first in line and ushering in a new world of possibilities for patients, families and caregivers. Being the first at something comes with its own struggles. But these struggles enable us to become stronger as a company, to be able to empower patients and providers in their journey, and to help change the healthcare landscape for the better."

CompanyA truly helped me realize not just my passion for mental health and sharing my story which relates to my patients, but also drove my passion for BrandD since I am helping patients who struggle with the same disease state as me. Hearing the passion and drive within CompanyA employees also motivates me and helps me to know I am not alone with depression. It makes me feel like I am in control and I can help not only myself, but help others to overcome depression, as I did. This defining moment truly helps the patients that we serve to know they are not alone. I am a patient who fit the BrandD patient profile.

Objectively measuring adherence, mood, activity, and rest would be groundbreaking to improve treatment of psychiatric patients. Along with the team, we worked with Proteus to put together the initial FDA filing, and finally received approval for BrandC MyCite in November 2017. CompanyA-people accomplished something extraordinary. I was excited and proud to be part of the first Digital Medicine approval in the world. FDA regulatory approval was a hurdle that we crossed first before any other pharmaceutical or biotech company. CompanyA works tirelessly to help improve the health of people globally.

My mother was diagnosed with associative identity disorder, however there were many diagnosis before that including bi-polar, schizophrenic etc. Fast forward to 2007, my beloved father committed suicide. More than a decade later, this affects me every single day. I am proud to work at CompanyA and know that what I do has the power to better the lives of other families. A psychiatrist told me about a patient he had been seeing who was a father of four. He said that his patient was going through financial and marital issues and that he had attempted suicide. After a failed attempt, he was hospitalized. The doctor decided to add BrandD on top of the patients antidepressant; it has been more than a year and the patient is living a normal life. He is enjoying time with his four children and hasn't had a suicidal thought since then. This story resonated with me because I am the oldest of four children, and I think about how different my life would be if my father had sought medical help. I feel grateful for the opportunity that I am given every day. This moment was life changing for the patients children. I can personally attest to that. Instances like this occur every single day, and the patients that CompanyA serves are able to find hope. Mental Illness does not only affect the individual, it affects family members, friends, colleagues and much more.
